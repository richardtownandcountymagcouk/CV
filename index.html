        <p>
          I offer an extensive background in financial services, with specialist expertise as a senior business analyst and digital change manager. I have gained exposure to regulatory change, migrations, automations and product builds, I bring a
          wealth
          of both technical and project management expertise to the table. As a self-motivated individual, I work well both in collaborative teams and on my own initiative. I effectively communicate and manage stakeholder expectations throughout the
          project lifecycle, from gathering requirements to building roadmaps to delivery. I take a proactive approach in mentoring and coaching the wider team to share my knowledge and experience. I am now seeking an opportunity to build my skills
          further within a dynamic environment.
